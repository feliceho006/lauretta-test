## Problem 1
In the folder, it contains the file ```count_dots.py```.
By changing the directory:
```python
def main():
    rootdir = "./galaxy" #change this
    filenames = os.listdir(rootdir)

    assemble_puzzle(rootdir,filenames)
```
It will iterate through the image files and display the completed puzzle.

## Problem 4
```cd``` into the folder and run ```npm start```

There are 2 pages implemented: ```Home.js``` and ```Book.js```.
In the home page, there is a search bar that allows the user to search the book based on its title and summary. The data is generated using mockaroo.com, and it simulates the data of the library.

In sample book page, it shows how the book will be displayed using a sample placeholder image.
